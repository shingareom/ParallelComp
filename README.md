# Parallel Computing

This repository contains the **Mid Sem Assessment** and **Teachers’ Assessment** work for the Department Elective subject **Parallel Computing** (Third Year CSE).

It includes two main parts:

1. [**Part 1 – MPI Cluster Environment Setup and Matrix Multiplication**](part1/README.md)
2. [**Part 2 – Vectorization using AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)**](part2/README.md)

---

## Project Overview

###  Part 1: MPI Cluster
- Setup of a **4-node MPI Cluster** over LAN/Wi-Fi using OpenMPI.
- Execution of a **parallel matrix multiplication** program.
- Each node performs a portion of the computation.
- Master node collects and displays the final matrix.

### Part 2: Vectorization and AVX
- Implementation of a **vectorized program** using AVX/SIMD.
- Comparison between normal and vectorized execution.
- Demonstration of performance improvement.
