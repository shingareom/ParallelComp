# Part 2 ‚Äì Vectorization and AVX Implementation

This part explores **data-level parallelism** using **Intel AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)**.  
It demonstrates how vectorized instructions can improve computational performance compared to scalar execution.

---

## üß© Objectives
- Implement a program that performs vectorized operations.
- Use **AVX intrinsics** or **compiler auto-vectorization**.
- Measure performance improvements.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check CPU AVX Support
```bash
lscpu | grep avx
2Ô∏è‚É£ Write or Compile with Vectorization
Compile with optimization:
gcc -O3 -march=native -ftree-vectorize vectorized_program.c -o vectorized
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run and Compare
Run both versions:
time ./non_vectorized
time ./vectorized
Compare the execution times and note the improvement.

üßÆ Example Programs
	‚Ä¢	Vector Addition
	‚Ä¢	Dot Product
	‚Ä¢	Matrix Multiplication (SIMD)
	‚Ä¢	Array Summation
